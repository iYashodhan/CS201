    should me taken from the user.
    B) Write a function to find out the employee record from this data base on
    the base of Emp_id.
    C) Write a function to sort the employee records on the base of
    Emp_id. D) Write a function to count the number of employees in data
    base.
    E) d. Write a function to add 5 more records in data base.

6. Write a program using functions to define a structure to describe a Book with
attributes such as title, author, no. of pages, price, number of sold copies, total
amount of sold copies etc. Declare an array of book and do the following
operations:
